        <li><span class="highlight"> Is it possible to set multiple initialization conditions using a 'for of' loop? I encountered this in Problem 7 (js line 73),
          where it was quite simple to code the required function inside a 'for of' loop, but I couldn't think of a way to declare a new variable AND iterively alter its value inside the loop.
        </span></li>
        <li><p></p><span class="highlight">In 'for of' loop syntax 'for (let VAR of ARRAY) {}', VAR is set to the identity of array[index], and the position of array[index]
          is hidden from the coder. I may have lost the plot a little bit, but is there a way, using 'for of' loops, to utilize the array
          position?</span></p> <p></p><span class="highlight">By contrast, in traditional for loop syntax, we declare an index variable and can access both index variable AND index identity throughout the loop.
          am I missing something in "for of" loops? </span></p></li>
